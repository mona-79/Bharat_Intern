# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features of houses in Bengaluru. The dataset used for this project is sourced from `Bengaluru_House_Data.xls`.

## Project Structure
- `Bengaluru_House_Data.xls`: Raw dataset containing information about houses in Bengaluru.
- `cleaned_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `RidgeModel.pkl`: Serialized trained Ridge Regression model for house price prediction.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Instructions for Running the Project
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the Jupyter Notebook `house_price_prediction.ipynb` to execute the code cells sequentially.
